hello there and thanks for admiring my little project. i hope it made you giggle while reading some of the things, i know i was chuckling to my self quite abit and people id show got a kick out of it too. however what the sites about isnt even the point its all the things i did to it to make it unique

-PROS
+ ive never seen another website like it. from the content, to the little details that you have no choice but to stop and say "hmm that was pretty cool" when you hover over the star and it does a cart wheel, or hover over the arrow button and it spins to the other side
+ the sign up page, man im so proud of that. i had fun making the placeholders. the phone number is from that tommy tutone song, the adress is drury lane from shrek, "favorite color" come on lol, and the social security is Elvis Presleys. also why would they need your SSN i put that as a like fake scammer.
+ how many websites can joke about sweatshops, if you havent read the paragraphs i suggest you do.

-CONS
+ i havent yet made it fully functional, by that i mean adaptable on other devices. it looks like a mess on the phone im gonna be so honest with you
+ it looks professional but i could not publish it, i dont know if it classifies as dark humor but its definitely not exactly family friendly. i could change that but..... nahh im sticking to my guns. funny is funny (8p)

-WHAT I LEARNED DURING THE PROJECT
 + i figured out how to make some letters have an outline to them with css (plan section)
 + i managed to add a background image, i was gonna make the whole site have a sandwich in the background but it looked tacky ngl. so i used it for the plan section with the copper, silver, and gold.
 + i got a couple images to rotate but it looked like a chucky cheese website with all that going on. i made the logo wind up when you hover and spin the other way when you let go. i also added this error page for all the links that didnt go anywhere, and the header kinda bobs back and forth. the logo on the sign up page does the spiny thing too with a -z index so its behind the words.
 + i also learned more things i can do with elements. like i didnt know there was a ridge and groove border (which are pretty much inverted) so i made them alternate when you hover over the already bouncing icons. sounds dumb and insignificant but im pretty proud of that ive never seen that before.
